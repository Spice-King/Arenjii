# Arenjii

	A Discord bot for rolling dice, Burning Wheel Style. 

## Want to add Arenjii to your Channel?

	Arenjii is still in development; there are still plenty of bugs to squash and there is no dedicated server, just the crappy laptop of a nightowl developer in the Easter Standard Time Zone.

	If that doesn't put you off, then by all means click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=434471882163748876&scope=bot)

## How can I help?

	If you are a developer feel free to FoRK the project (Ha! Burning Wheel pun!) and tinker, and contact me with questions/suggestions. Arenjii is written in Javascript.

	If you are not a developer, I could always use people dedicated and/or crazy enough to make some of the weirdest rolls possible and try to break the bot, point out where I've gotten the rules wrong and give feedback and suggestions about every aspect of it's features.
